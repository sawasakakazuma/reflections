What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

     .git directory is created. This directory is used for storing some management files.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

    The staging area is under control of git, whereas the working directory itself isn't. The repository is like a git directory, but it doesn't offer such a functionality as managing difference between files, which the staging area does.
